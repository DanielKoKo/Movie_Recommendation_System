# Movie_Recommendation_System
This is a Python-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their existing reviews.

## Project Description
* This program uses the MovieLens dataset to recommend movies by considering not only user reviews, but also the genres of the highest rated movies.
  * The MovieLens dataset contains more than 20 million user ratings and 62,000 movies ranging from 1995 to 2019, with each user having rated at least 20 movies.

* We use K-Nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity to implement the bulk of the recommendation system.
